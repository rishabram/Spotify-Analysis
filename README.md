# Spotify Playlist Analysis

This project is a comparative analysis of two Spotify playlists using **R**, focusing on data wrangling, statistical testing, and visualization to derive actionable insights into musical attributes such as BPM, energy, danceability, loudness, and more.

## Overview
The analysis explores differences between playlists to understand their musical profiles. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques and intuitive visualizations, this project highlights key trends and relationships in the data.

## Features
- **Data Wrangling:** 
  - Combined and cleaned datasets using **Tidyverse** for streamlined analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** 
  - Conducted **t-tests** to assess statistically significant differences in track features.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Created **density plots** and **boxplots** to display feature distributions.
  - Built **radar charts** for side-by-side comparison of playlist characteristics.
  - Generated **correlation heatmaps** to identify relationships between musical attributes.
- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Languages:** R
  - **Libraries:** ggplot2, dplyr, gridExtra, GGally, reshape2, fmsb

## Results
- Uncovered differences in musical attributes such as BPM, energy, and valence between playlists.
- Provided insights for playlist curation and audience engagement using data-driven decisions.
- Delivered a reproducible analysis pipeline with visually compelling outputs.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Proficiency in **data analysis** and **statistical modeling**.
- Expertise in creating **visual narratives** with **ggplot2** and related libraries.
- Experience in applying **data visualization techniques** for exploratory and comparative analysis.

This project highlights the ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data and transform them into actionable recommendations through advanced data analysis and visualization techniques.
